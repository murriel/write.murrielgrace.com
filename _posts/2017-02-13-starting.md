After a moderate amount of angst over how to get started with writing after years of rust, I decided to skip the preamble and small talk in favor of generating content. Basically, I told myself: "Shut up and start writing."

So, hello world and whatever it is kids say these days (hint: they're probably not saying hello world). My current goal is to just start writing. I will make no promises about the content, but this little web log that could will probably cover one or more of the following topics:

- tech
- music
- podcasts
- lists
- personal projects
- cats

Thank you for joining me on this little adventure!
