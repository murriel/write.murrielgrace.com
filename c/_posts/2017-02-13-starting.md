description: hello world, or I decided to start writing again
---

After a moderate amount of angst over how to start writing again after years of rust, I decided to skip the preamble and small talk in favor of generating content. Basically, I told myself: "Shut up and start writing."

So, hello world and whatever it is kids say these days (hint: they're probably not saying hello world). My current goal is to start writing, so there may be a fair amount of rambling. I will make no promises about the content, but this "little web log that could" will probably cover one or more of the following topics:

- tech
- music
- podcasts
- lists
- personal projects
- cats

Thank you for joining me on this little adventure!
