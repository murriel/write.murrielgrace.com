<!-- This is a reference sample for a standard Jekyll post in Markdown.
Might consider adding some other markup language but I'm not too interested
in anything other than Markdown at the moment.

Other notes:

Filename must be in this format:
YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.markdown OR
YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.md

The YAML front matter block is specified in the section between the triple-dashed lines and tells
Jekyll to interpret and format the file using Jekyll rules.
